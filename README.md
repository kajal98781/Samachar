# Redux-Saga
## Getting Started
Saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. **redux-saga** is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.

It uses an ES6 feature called Generators to make those asynchronous flows easy to read, write and test.
```
npm install redux-saga
```
